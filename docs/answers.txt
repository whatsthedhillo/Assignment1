5. Teams may work on the same repository or project without interfering with one another. This can be useful 
for: fixing bugs, or implementing new features.

git log only operates on the committed history.

9. Inheritance is when a class system is defined as such when there are sub classes that derive from,
or take the main properties of a super, or parent, class.
Polymorphism is what allows different object types to behave differently, according to how their methods or functions are
implemented.
Encapsulation binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, 
and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.

10. It uses polymorphism. The different classes behave differently, thanks to functions being defined uniquely for
different classes. It uses encapsulation, as the member data for the classes are not directly accessible. One must 
access them through the use of set and get functions.
